## Big-React

This is a minimum implementation of the core process of 'react'.

**All the key functions have been added with JsDoc, and you can clearly understand the working content of each function.**

**'package' refers to the core package we implemented:**

1. **react-reconciler:** The core reconciliation engine, responsible for calculating how to update the UI
2. **react-dom-bindings:**  Convert the update instructions of react-reconciler into actual browser DOM operations
3. **scheduler:** Task Scheduler

**You can understand all the implementations of the entire library based on the submission history.**
